# About me

Iâ€™m an Evolutionary Ecologist currently doing a postdoc with Jordi Bascompte at the University of Zurich. My scientific goal is to understand how the ecology and evolution of species interactions affect the dynamics of ecosystems and to instill an appreciation for these phenomena in others. Check out the rest of my website to see how I'm achieving this goal.
