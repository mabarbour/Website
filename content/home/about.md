**I study food webs ---how they're formed, how they function, and how they're changing.** I'm particularly interested in understanding the food webs created by insects. These little animals comprise the majority of species in the animal kingdom and the food webs they form influence the health of both agricultural and natural ecosystems. Check out my Project or Publications pages to learn more about the research I'm doing.

I'm particularly interested understanding the trophic interactions between plants, the insects that feed on them, and the insects that parasitize those insects (if you don't know what a parasitoid is, click here to have your mind blown)<!--herbivorous insects, and parasitoid wasps.

**I study how ecological interactions shape the structure and dynamics of biodiversity ---from genes to ecosystems.** My research incorporates state-of-the-art methods from diverse fields, including quantitative genetics, evolutionary ecology, and complex networks. I apply these methods to field observations as well as field and lab experiments designed to answer fundamental questions about the structure and dynamics of biodiversity. While my taxonomic expertise is broad, my current and future research focuses on plants, herbivorous insects, and their parasitoids, whose feeding interactions regulate much of Earth's biodiversity.

My goals as an evolutionary ecologist are twofold: (1) understand how ecological interactions shape the structure and dynamics of biodiversity ---from genes to ecosystems; and (2) communicate the importance of conserving biodiversity through teaching and community outreach.


I study how ecological interactions shape the structure and dynamics of biodiversity ---from genes to ecosystems. I also actively engage in teaching and community outreach to communicate the importance of conserving biodiversity.  
Iâ€™m an Evolutionary Ecologist currently doing a postdoc with Jordi Bascompte at the University of Zurich. My scientific goal is to understand how the ecology and evolution of species interactions affect the dynamics of ecosystems and to instill an appreciation for these phenomena in others. Check out the rest of my website to see how I'm achieving this goal.
