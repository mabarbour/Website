Ecologists are tasked with the urgent challenge of predicting how populations, communities, and ecosystems will respond to environmental change. 
A food-web approach is well suited to addressing this challenge as the strength and organization of trophic interactions (food-web structure) influences the abundance of populations, the diversity of species in a community, and the flow of energy through an ecosystem.
Nevertheless, most food-web research does not consider the diverse sources of biological variation (biodiversity) that ultimately <!--scale up to-->determine the form and function of food webs<!--food-web structure.-->.  
This limits our current ability to predict how the structure and function of food webs will respond to ongoing environmental change. 

**My research aims to better understand the forces shaping food-web structure so that we can better predict the dynamics of populations, communities, and ecosystems in a changing world.** 
I conduct field observations as well as field and lab experiments in order to better understand how changes in the biotic and abiotic environment affect food-web structure. 
To gain new insights, I often incorporate methods from fields outside of traditional food-web research, such as quantitative genetics and adaptive landscapes.
I also develop [theoretical models](https://boring-fermat-2807cd.netlify.com/publication/ecd_model/) to help guide future empirical studies. 
My current research is focused on addressing two major challenges: (i) *Scaling from genes-to-ecosystems in a changing world*; and (ii) *Predicting food-web dynamics across space and time*.

Questions that guide my current and future research include: (1) How does intraspecific variation structure multitrophic communities? (2) How does community context shape phenotypic evolution?

Biodiversity is more than simply the amount of genetic diversity within a population or the number of species in a community. Such coarse notions of biodiversity lend us little power in predicting the robustness of populations or communities to environmental change. In contrast, the structure of biodiversity (**biostructure**) can have profound consequences for its robustness. For example, the structure of a population's G-matrix (additive genetic (co)variances in functional traits) determines its capacity to evolve in response to novel selection pressures. Similarly, the strength and organization of trophic interactions (food-web structure) determine how communities and ecosystems will respond to disturbances. While it is clear that biostructure underlies the robustness of biodiversity, we know little about how biostructure is shaped across biological scales. Ecological interactions (e.g. predation, pollination, herbivory, parasitism) provide a mechanistic link between biostructure at different levels of biological organization. This is because ecological interactions link populations in a community context and can shape, and be shaped by, heritable trait (co)variation.
