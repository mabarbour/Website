Although the coevolution of predator and prey are thought to be strongly influenced by their mutual behavior, we know surprisingly little about the dynamics of these behavioral interactions in natural settings. During my Master's, I conducted systematic field observations to test the hypothesis that tail-flagging displays given by ground squirrels function as predator-deterrent signals toward rattlesnakes. I discovered that snakes were less likely to strike at tail-flagging squirrels because these signals honestly advertise a squirrel's readiness to dodge an attack. Moreover, rattlesnakes abandoned ambush sites soon after receiving tail-flag displays because these displays simultaneously signalled the snakeâ€™s presence to nearby squirrels, reducing the probability of a snake capturing nearby prey. By demonstrating the adaptive response of rattlesnakes to tail-flag displays, my work provides one of the best examples of coevolution maintaining predator-deterrent signals in nature (Barbour and Clark, *Proc. R. Soc. B*). This work has also spurred multiple collaborations that have given new insight to the coevolution of rattlesnakes and their prey (e.g. Barbour and Clark, *Ethology*; Clark, Tangco, and Barbour, *Animal Behaviour*)
