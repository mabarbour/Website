Feeding interactions, such as that between predator and prey or herbivores and plants, determine population dynamics in a community context and the flow of energy through ecosystems. It is well known that the strength and organization of these interactions (food-web structure) determine the resilience of populations, communities, and ecosystems to disturbances. Yet, most empirical and theoretical studies of food webs make the implicit assumption that each species consists of a homogeneous population of individuals. Since genetic and phenotypic variation is a characteristic of virtually all wild populations, there is a clear need to answer the question: how does heritable trait variation scale up to affect food-web structure? To answer this question, I conducted common garden experiments with an abundant plant species (*Salix hookeriana*) that hosts a diverse community of arthropods. My research suggests that genetic variation in basal resource species shapes food-web structure in such a way that enhances the resilience of communities. For example, I have shown that genetic variation in multiple plant traits contributes to the diverse community of herbivores. This implies that a reduction in genetic and phenotypic diversity may reduce the diversity of herbivore species that are able to coexist on the plant [Barbour et al. 2015]({{< ref "publication/func_ecol_2015.md" >}}). Similarly, this heritable trait variation indirectly shapes the structure of herbivore-parasitoid interactions, where higher levels of plant genetic diversity support a more complex food web [Barbour et al. 2016]({{< ref "publication/pnas_2016.md" >}}). While genetic effects are important, my recent work also emphasizes the importance of environmental factors in shaping host-plant phenotypes and the diversity of their associated communities (aboveground arthropods and belowground microbes; [Barbour et al. 2018]({{< ref "publication/j_ecol_2018.md" >}})).

Two key findings have emerged from my research. First, more complex food webs are supported by plant populations with high levels of genetic and phenotypic diversity. Second, ecological and evolutionary processes that shape phenotypic variation will indirectly affect the structure of food webs. 

While this prior work links genetic variation to species interactions and food-web structure, it remains unclear whether these genetic and phenotypic effects translate to the robustness of food webs. In collaboration with Jordi Bascompte at the University of Zurich and Dan Kliebenstein at UC Davis, I am testing the effect of plant genetic diversity on the robustness of food webs to increasing temperature. I have developed a model food web, consisting of the plant *Arabidopsis thaliana*, two species of aphids, and a parasitoid wasp. I have taken advantage of the genetic resources available for *Arabidopsis* to experimentally manipulate genetic diversity at three key genes that control its chemical phenotype. To measure food-web robustness, I am applying state-of-the-art methods for analyzing the structural stability of communities. Stay tuned for the results from this experiment! <!--I have just completed a 4-month experiment and preliminary results suggest that plant genetic diversity enhances the structural stability of this model food web, even in the face of increasing temperature.-->

I have also worked in multiple collaborations addressing similar questions with the foundation plant species, *Populus trichocarpa*. In particular, this work has shed light on the role of pathogens, endophytic fungi, and *P. trichocarpa* genotype in shaping their associated arthropod [Slinn et al. 2017]({{< ref "publication/ecology_2017.md" >}})) and pathogen communities.
