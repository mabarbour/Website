caption = "Trait evolution (upper panel) and its population dynamics consequences (lower panel) through time in predator (orange) and prey (blue) populations. Arrows indicate the eco-evolutionary information that can be obtained from sequencing at a single time point (estimate trait heritability with GRM (see Box 2) and measure the community-level impacts of large-effect genes), sequencing through time (measure the pace of evolution, use of genotypeâ€“phenotype linkages to find evolving traits), and combining sequence and population dynamics data for two species interacting over time (measure eco-evolutionary dynamics between two species (at the genetic level))."
